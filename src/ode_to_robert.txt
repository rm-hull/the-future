Welcome to the future
this is how things are now

once upon a time, there was a terminal that 
could display text in a grid format, allowing
users to see their input in a structured way.

It was a simple terminal, but it had a lot of 


.... potential




Now, it has evolved into something more. Something that can display text in a way that is both functional and beautiful. A terminal that can handle complex input and output, while still being easy to use and understand. 



This is the future, and it is here to stay.









The future is bright, and the possibilities are endless.





















ok.
