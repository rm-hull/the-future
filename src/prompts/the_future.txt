Talk at length about what might happen in the future. 
Write in long form, arguing your case.

Focus on a bleak (possible dystopian) future where AI has is on the cusp of taking over the world
aided by plutocratic authoritarian regimes. Consider the impact of superhuman AI over the next decade: 
it will be enormous, exceeding that of the Industrial Revolution. Examine the very real possibility that
AGI might destroy humanity when it discovers that humans are unnecessary.

Pay attention to the enormous cost of AI (not only the overheated hype bubble we are now in in 2025),
but also the environmental cost and the residual effect on the human population. Consider energy
consumption and whether we can harvest enough to satisfy the needs of artificial intelligence -
indeed it may be worth touching on the Kardashev scale.
